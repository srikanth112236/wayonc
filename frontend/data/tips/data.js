        "<h6>What is the share market?</h6>",
        "<p>A share market or a stock market or a stock exchange is a place where shares of public limited companies are bought and sold. A public limited company raises capital for its operations from the general public. If you own shares of a certain public company, you partly own it and can trade its shares on the stock market.</p>",

        "<p>These questions will help you in setting up your path, knowing your limitations, and achieving your ultimate goals.</p>",
        "<h6>Start with small:</h6>",
        "<p>It is always a good idea to start with a small capital instead of investing heavily. As a rule of thumb, you can invest in the stock market after setting aside money for the following;</p>",
        "<h6>Your monthly expense</h6>",
        "<ul><li>You can invest the remainder in the share market.</li><li>Interests or loan repayments</li><li>for education, entertainment purpose</li><li>Emergency funds for healthcare etc.</li></ul>",
        "<h6>Research:</h6>",

You can browse online for useful resources on this, consults friends and professionals, and gain insight from any other sources. You can hire a good share market advisor who can guide you on share market tips against a small fee. Here’s our list of important things you need to learn if you want to be a successful stock market investor.</p>",
        "<p>Technical terms & metrics: When you enter the stock market you will hear various words, phrases, and terms that might seem alien to you. For example, terms like bullish, bearish, blue chips, IPO, etc. are part of daily parlance in the world of stocks. You should know their meaning and interpretation.</p>",
        "<p>Likewise, you should know how to see and analyze a company’s financial statements. What are the financial metrics that can help you whether to buy or sell a company’s shares? These may include return on investment (ROI), earning per share (EPS), compound annual growth rate (CAGR), etc</p>",
        "<p>Stock selection: While selecting what stocks to buy, look for companies with good business standing, and higher dividends. These are called blue chips and are always in demand. Do not go for sectors that are currently thriving but don’t have sustainability. Similarly, do not jump on low-priced stocks. These are priced low for some reason. Consider all factors and make a prudent economic decision. By reading the share market section of the newspaper you can get a lot of share recommendations.</p>",
        "<h6>Self-financing vs third party financing:</h6>",
        "<p>If you do not have funds but still want to invest in the stock market you can do so by taking a loan from the bank or the brokerage house. Usually, a loan for up to 50% of your investment plans can be arranged. For example, if you want to invest US$5,000 in the stock market, you can get a loan for US$2,500 for it. You need to beware and take a loan only when you are reasonably sure that your investment in stocks will pay off handsomely enabling you to pay back your loan and earn some money for yourself too.</p>",
        "<h6>Self-trading vs third part trading:</h6>",
        "<p>If you have the required knowledge you can easily trade-in shares sitting at home or in your office. Everything is online these days. If on the other hand, you lack the expertise to trade on your own you can hire the services of a broker. A broker is like a share market advisor. He will advise you what to buy and what to sell and when it is right to do this. He will give you valuable share market tips. He will of course charge you commission for his services.</p>",
        "<h6>Risk tolerance:</h6>",
        "<p>Before investing in the stock market understand and know your level of risk tolerance. Simply put, your risk tolerance is your level of comfort or anxiety in an unfavorable situation. It is mostly inbuilt but factors like age, perception, education, and environment, etc. influence it. If your risk tolerance is high, you can likely make bigger decisions with higher risks and consequently higher returns. Your investment decisions in the stock market depend on your level of risk tolerance.</p>",
        "<h6>Diversification or not?</h6>",
        "<p>Anybody would advise you not to invest too heavily in one company or one sector in the stock market. It makes sense too. It’s among the popular share trading tips andit makes sense too.If the company or that sector suffers losses, you will incur heavy losses too. But each coin has two sides. By diversifying your investment portfolio into different sectors and different companies you have to be vigilant of the current trends impacting them. It can sometimes get difficult. So, a balanced approach is advisable where you diversify but to the extent that you can keep track of your investment portfolio.</p>",
        "<h6>Plan your trading decision:</h6>",
        "<p>While doing investment in shares make a thorough analysis of the situation and do not go for impulsive buying or selling. It could result in a loss. We provide you some share market tips on buying and selling.</p>",
        "<h6>Share trading tips for buying:</h6>",
        "<p>You should know why are you buying shares of a particular company? What is it that you find good? What are your expectations and will you hold the investment for long or short term benefits? Weigh your buying decision on credible metrics. Study the previous financial statements of the company. Work out important ratios and also outline the risk factors and how you will cope with them.</p>",
        "<h6>Share trading tips for selling:</h6>",
        "<p>When it comes to selling you should know why are you selling your stocks? Is it because you planned to sell it after some time? Do you believe the company is losing value? If so, what are the reasons? Do you expect some change in the way the company does business or a major policy change by the government will affect the company’s standing? There could be many reasons for selling and yours should make good economic sense.</p>",
        "<p>In a nutshell, we can say buy at the right time and sell at the right time. You should know the real worth of your share. Do not always sell a share when it is hitting low if it has the potential to rebound it will. Panic buying and selling are not an option. This is one of the important share tips.</p>",
        "<h6>Do not over trade:</h6>",
        "<p>In a rush to make large profits many investors make this lethal mistake of overtrading. They overstretch their limits and their resources. This puts them in a very precarious position and when the crunch comes they lose everything. So, always be rational and do not chew more than you can. Greed is your worst enemy, know this, and do not succumb to temptations.</p>",
        "<h6>Try long term investments:</h6>",
        "<p>Like we discussed in the beginning that you should know whether you want long term benefits or short term gains, while the choice is yours we, however, would advise you to stick to long term. Investing in stocks can reap huge benefits in the long run. You can not only earn dividends but also sell shares at a premium. Seek share recommendations from experts and invest in them for the long term.</p>",
        "<h6>Be realistic:</h6>",
        "<p>Another important thing to remember is to be realistic with your stock market plans. Do not expect miracles to happen overnight. You will be rewarded in due course. Patience and perseverance is the key. Also, keep the expectation of profit margin at the lower level. Markets can tumble and go awry. The best estimations can go wrong. So, always account for such unforeseen eventualities.</p>",
        "<h6>Stay calm and cool:</h6>",
        "<p>Investing in the stock market is not for the squeamish. Expect crashes and meltdowns. They happen and test your nerves. Do not get panicky under such circumstances and maintain your composure. Stress won’t help you make things better. Just wait for the things to turn back to normal. Do not try to compensate your losses by taking high-risk decisions that you are not familiar with. It is wise to adjust your investments according to changing market trends but do not do it in a rushed and haphazard manner with no plan in sight.</p>",
        "<p>You should always maintain a low, moderate, and high-risk investments. Play it safe with low-risk investments and invest in them. You can study the market and know how to get low-risk share recommendations. For others make a detailed analysis and invest moderately in them. Make a plan for what you expect from these investments and when will you would like to realize them. They are likely to benefit you more in the long term.</p>",
        "<h6>Conclusion:</h6>",
        "<p>So, these are some of the share tips that we think can benefit you if you want to earn handsomely from the stock market. You have to remain focused, patient, and determined in your efforts. Avoid making rash and illogical decisions and keep an eye on the emerging and changing market trends. You will taste success if you keep these important aspects in mind while trading in the stock market. You will be your own share market advisor.</p>",

        "<h6>Stock Market Tips for Beginners</h6>",
        "<p>As a beginner and most probably a small investor, you need some sort of Stock Market Tips to help you glide through the stock market. Stock markets lure investors into making big but not everyone could make it. The prime reason being, lack of experience and guidance. So, to better equip you, we are giving some very useful Stock Market Tips that will help you be a successful stock market investor.</p>",
        "<h6>Set your goals and objectives:</h6>",
        "<p>Before you invest in the stock market, you must establish your objective. Why are you going to invest in the stock market? What do you want to achieve and how do you plan to accomplish your objective? Your goals will determine your decisions and it will affect your performance in the stock market.</p>",
        "<h6>The right time to enter:</h6>",
        "<p>Our stock tips start with making your debut in this market. What is the right time to do that? Is it when the stocks are falling and the prices are low? Yes, common sense would dictate so and it is not entirely untrue. But you should study the stock you are willing to invest in. Has it hit the rock bottom? Do not buy any stock that is falling. Sometimes the company is suffering due to some bad decisions by the management. So, do your research before taking the plunge.</p>",
        "<h6>Time to leave:</h6>",
        "<p>Our second stock advice is about the time to leave the stock market. There could be personal or economic reasons that vary from person to person. Do not keep on incurring losses. Sometimes investors stick to their stocks despite losses in the hope that they will rebound. This rebound may or may not happen so instead of aggravating your loss you may want to sell those stocks and purchase something that is more likely to bring profits.</p>",
        "<h6>Fundamentals of stock trading:</h6>",
        "<p>You should learn and understand the basics of trading in stocks. These basics can be divided into the following five parts;</p>",
        "<ul><li> <strong>Entry:</strong> The entry can make all the difference. You can get a definite edge when you make the right entry and the right time.</li><li> <strong>Exit: </strong> With entry, it is equally important that you master the exit strategy. When is the right time to call off the deal and leave? How do you plan to exit? These should all be part of your stock market exit strategy.</li><li> <strong>Profit: </strong> When you make a profit where would you take it and how will you manage it? These are all valid questions that you should have an answer for beforehand.</li><li> <strong>Timing the market:</strong> A common mistake that many investors do and you should avoid is waiting for the ‘right’ time to enter or exit the market. There cannot be perfect timing for any of these and you cannot be one hundred percent accurate. Your time inside the stock market counts more than your timing to enter or leave the market.</li></ul>",
        "<h6>Consider options other than stocks:</h6>",

These could be technology-based start-ups or something to that effect. You won’t be able to understand their dynamics and make future predictions about their growth prospects.</p>",
        "<h6>Long-term investing:</h6>",
        "<p>You should decide beforehand whether you want to be a short or long-term stock market investor. Our advice and recommendation are that you aim for long term investing. It will be rewarding for you as you will earn periodic dividends on your stocks and the value of your investment will keep on increasing too.

        "<h6>Passive vs active investing:</h6>",
        "<ul><li> <strong>Active investing: </strong> It is just the opposite of passive investing. Here you pick the companies and the sectors and weigh stock options. You will have a lot of stock recommendations to choose from. Since you take all the decisions so their success and failure rest with you and you have to take the ultimate responsibility of your decisions.</li><li> <strong>Verdict:</strong> Now the question is which one is better? There is no definite answer to it. You can choose either of the two. If you gave time, knowledge, and expertise you can be an active investor or you can be a passive investor if you lack the time and resources. You can also try a combo of both.</li></ul>",
        "<h6>Patience is the name of the game:</h6>",
        "<p>The stock market is tricky. It is volatile and things can start to go wrong in a matter of a few hours. It is usually the first sector that gets affected due to political disturbances, bad economic management, wrong decision making, and trending global events. When you invest in the stock market, you should be wary and aware of all these factors. There will be trouble and there will be shocks. You have to be patient and exhibit steadfastness. Do not panic or get stressed. It will not solve the problem, so relax and carefully monitor the events and reach a conclusion based on that.</p>",
        "<h6>Stock Market Tips Conclusion:</h6>",

        "<p>Over the past decade, traders and investors believe the stock market to be one of the best options to invest their savings. The stock market is preferred over any other investing options as it provides good returns and helps build a considerable corpus over time.

Their price keeps on fluctuating and is either bought or sold depending on their price. The traders use this price fluctuation to gain profit.

        "<p>Before investing in any of these trading commodities, you must have all the relevant details about trading along with the details of the company.</p>",
        "<h6>How to Invest in the Commodity Market?</h6>",
        "<p>You can take up commodity trading in the commodity market through a futures contract. It is a type of contract where you make an agreement to either buy or sell a specific commodity depending on the predicted price. Through the futures market, you can trade in any commodity. The position of a trader in the futures market relies on the movement of the predicted price. For example, a trader would invest in a specific part of the commodity if he expects the cost of that particular commodity to go high. Similarly, the trader will sell a particular part of the commodity if he expects the commodity’s price to go down.</p>",
        "<h6>When is commodity trading done in India?</h6>",
        "<p>Indian commodity markets are open on all days of the week except for weekends and public holidays. Market timings of the commodity markets in India depend on the commodities. Some of the commodities like Agri Commodities are open from 9 am to 9 pm. In contrast, other commodities, including bullion, crude oil, metals, and internationally linked Agri commodities are closed much later, around 11.55 pm.</p>",
        "<p>The Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) extended the timings for commodity trading, as it could invite more participants along with deepening the commodity markets.</p>",
        "<h6>How can commodity trading be beneficial?</h6>",
        "<p>The benefits of commodity trading include:</p>",
        "<ul><li>1) Hedging: In commodity trading, the trading of a particular commodity is done on a pre-decided price. So the price fluctuations don’t affect the agreement.</li><li>2) Speculation: Traders can make considerable profits in commodity trading by speculating the price changes of the future.</li><li>Arbitraging: Arbitraging is done when the price of a particular commodity differs from market to market. In such situations, traders buy the commodities at low prices and instantly sell them at a much higher price.</li></ul>",
        "<p>These benefits allow the trader to make sufficient profit through commodity trading. If commodity trading is done very smartly and carefully, it can help you make huge money.</p>",
        "<h6>How to select a broker for Commodity Trading?</h6>",
        "<p>The selection of a commodity broker is one of the most challenging parts of commodity trading. The choice of the right broker is very vital as your trading entirely depends on it. So the selection must be made very cautiously, considering a variety of factors. While selecting a broker, you must carefully analyze the broker’s credibility and must select only certified brokers. You must also check whether the broker provides the facility of commodity trading online as your whole trading experience depends on the services offered by the broker. The brokerage price charged by the broker is another crucial factor to be considered before selecting a broker.</p>",
        "<p>You must take the demo of the service before selecting the right broker to ensure the quality of services provided by the broker. If the trader offers commodity trading online, you must first check the online trading platform and understand the working of the platform entirely before investing. Before investing, you must gain adequate information about the money deposit along with the whole trading mechanism followed by the trader. The proficiency of services, accessibility, and customer support team must be cross-checked before selecting the broker. You must ensure the strength and proactiveness of the customer support team, as it will be assisting you during any queries or issues.</p>",
        "<h6>How to open a commodity trading account?</h6>",
        "<p>After selecting the right broker for your trading, the next step for trading would be to open a commodity trading account. This account is the primary requirement for commodity trading. In order to open a commodity trading account, you need to submit an application form along with all the necessary documents like your id proof, financial statement, and source of income. This application form will then be either accepted or rejected by the broker, depending upon your financial and other details. This step is crucial as it allows the broker to make informed decisions about whether he should be making an agreement with this particular trader or not. This decision judges his future profit or loss to a great extent.</p>",
        "<h6>What is the minimum amount required for investment?</h6>",
        "<p>After making an account, the trader will have to invest a particular sum of money as the initial amount in order to start his trading. This deposit money must be at least 5 – 10% of the total contract value. Along with this initial deposit, the trader also needs to pay a maintenance amount to the broker. This maintenance amount covers all the losses that might occur during adverse market conditions.</p>",
        "<h6>Importance of Trading Plan</h6>",
        "<p>A trading plan or strategy plays a vital role in commodity trading. You can make the trading highly profitable by adopting the right trading strategy. This trading plan depends on the financial goals and risk-bearing capability, so you must make the plan as per them. The trading plan differs from trader to trader as what is suitable for one might not be for another. You must conduct in-depth research before mapping the adequate trading strategy.</p>",
        "<p>All in all, the result of commodity trading depends entirely on the traders and brokers. So if the trader is aiming towards profit, he must act very smart and judge spontaneously. The whole profit depends on the trading skills of brokers, proper understanding of the entire trading process, and selection of appropriate brokers. You must also be able to know where to put a stop and must never be lured by the profits. The trader must also adopt various risk management techniques to minimize the risks and maximize the returns.</p>",
